The Flutter MVVM Template is a project template designed to kickstart your Flutter app development using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern and integrating the powerful features of Firebase.


## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a robust and scalable template that follows the MVVM architecture, enabling you to build high-quality Flutter apps with ease. By leveraging the capabilities of Firebase, you can quickly implement essential features such as user authentication, real-time data synchronization, and push notifications.

## Features

- **Firebase Authentication**: Implement user authentication using Firebase, supporting various methods such as email/password, Google Sign-In, and more.
- **Firebase Cloud Firestore**: Utilize Firestore as the database for your app, enabling real-time data synchronization and seamless offline support.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications to your users and keep them engaged.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Follow the MVVM architectural pattern, separating the concerns of the data model, UI views, and view models, promoting code organization and testability.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilize dependency injection to manage the app's dependencies and improve maintainability.
- **FVM**: Implement FVM for the management of the Flutter versions.
